Key Patterns for Identifying Failed Login Attempts:

    Excessive Failed Login Attempts from a Single User (Brute Force Attack)
        Pattern: Multiple failed login attempts within a short time frame for the same AccountName.
        Explanation: This could indicate a brute force attack where an attacker tries multiple passwords to gain access to a specific account.
        Example: 10 failed login attempts for the user admin in 5 minutes.

    Failed Logins from Multiple Users on a Single Machine (Spray Attack)
        Pattern: Failed logins for multiple AccountName values originating from the same Source IP or Machine.
        Explanation: This pattern could indicate a password spray attack where an attacker attempts a few common passwords across many accounts.
        Example: Failed login attempts for user1, user2, user3 from IP 192.168.1.10.

    Unusual Logon Types for Failed Attempts
        Pattern: Repeated failed logon attempts with unusual LogonType values.
        Explanation: Specific logon types (e.g., RemoteInteractive, Batch, or Network) might indicate attempts to access the system in non-standard ways, such as via Remote Desktop or automated scripts.
        Example: Multiple failed logins with LogonType 10 (RemoteInteractive) or 3 (Network).

    Failed Logins with Invalid or Disabled Account States
        Pattern: Failed logon attempts where FailureReason is AccountDisabled, AccountExpired, AccountLockedOut, or InvalidUserName.
        Explanation: Anomalous patterns involving disabled or invalid accounts could indicate attempts to access accounts that are no longer valid or deliberately locked out.
        Example: Multiple failed login attempts with FailureReason AccountDisabled.

    Failed Logins Outside of Normal Business Hours
        Pattern: Failed login attempts that occur outside typical working hours or scheduled maintenance windows.
        Explanation: If failed login attempts are detected during odd hours (e.g., midnight or weekends), they may indicate an unauthorized attempt.
        Example: Failed logins between 1 AM and 3 AM when no users are expected to be active.

    High Frequency of Failed Logins from a Single IP Address
        Pattern: Multiple failed login attempts originating from the same Source IP.
        Explanation: This may indicate that a specific external IP address is targeting a server or workstation for malicious access.
        Example: 100 failed login attempts from IP 203.0.113.45 within 30 minutes.

    Sequential Failed Logins for Different Users in a Short Time Frame
        Pattern: Sequential failed login attempts for different users from the same source within seconds.
        Explanation: This could indicate a script or automated tool attempting to guess passwords for different accounts.
        Example: Failed logins for user1, user2, user3 within a 10-second window from the same IP.

    Logons with Common Attack Vectors in Usernames
        Pattern: Failed logon attempts using commonly targeted usernames like admin, administrator, root, test, or other default system accounts.
        Explanation: These are common entry points that attackers attempt to gain access to high-privileged accounts.
        Example: Multiple failed attempts targeting administrator.

    Patterns Involving Geographic Location of IP Address
        Pattern: Failed login attempts from unusual geographic locations compared to normal user activity.
        Explanation: Anomalous geographic patterns might indicate an attempt from a foreign or unexpected location.
        Example: Logins from IPs registered in different countries when users are normally local.

    Recurrent Failed Logins Followed by a Successful Login
        Pattern: A pattern where multiple failed attempts are immediately followed by a successful login.
        Explanation: This could indicate that an attacker has finally guessed the correct password after multiple attempts.
        Example: 5 failed login attempts for admin followed by a successful login from the same IP.

How to Utilize These Patterns:

    Data Aggregation: Collect and aggregate log data from different sources to detect patterns over time.
    Statistical Analysis: Use statistical methods like Z-score to determine outliers in failed login frequencies.
    Machine Learning: Use machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to learn normal user behavior and flag deviations as potential anomalies.
    Threshold-based Alerts: Set thresholds for certain metrics (e.g., number of failed logins per minute) to generate alerts when these thresholds are exceeded.
    Correlate with Other Events: Combine failed login attempts with other security events (e.g., firewall logs, IDS alerts) to gain a comprehensive view of potential threats.
