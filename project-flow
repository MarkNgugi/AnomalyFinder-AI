1. Log Collection and Streaming:

    Use Log Shippers: Instead of a script, you could use log shippers like Fluentd, Logstash, or Filebeat to collect logs in real-time from Windows machines.
    Stream Logs to a Message Broker: Send the collected logs directly to a message broker like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis. These tools are optimized for handling high-throughput, real-time data streams.

2. Real-Time Log Processing:

    Implement Stream Processing: Use a stream processing framework like Apache Flink, Apache Storm, or Apache Kafka Streams to process logs in real-time. These frameworks can apply your AI anomaly detection models to the data as it flows through the pipeline.
    Directly Stream to AI Models: If your AI models support streaming inputs, you can directly feed the normalized logs from the stream processor to the AI models without waiting for the data to be stored.

3. Optimizing AI Model Performance:

    Deploy AI Models as Microservices: Consider deploying each anomaly detection module as a microservice. This way, each module can independently scale based on demand, and logs can be routed to the appropriate service for processing.
    Batch Processing with Windows: If real-time processing is not necessary for all logs, you can implement a sliding window approach, where logs are analyzed in short, overlapping time windows to detect anomalies without the overhead of processing every single log immediately.

4. Efficient Storage and Retrieval:

    Time Series Databases: For storing logs, consider using a time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. These are optimized for high-ingestion rates and can quickly query recent data for analysis.
    Hybrid Storage Strategy: Use MongoDB for archival storage but keep recent logs in an in-memory database like Redis for faster access by the AI models.

5. Monitoring and Scaling:

    Autoscaling Infrastructure: Use cloud services that support autoscaling, so your infrastructure can automatically adjust to the load, ensuring that the processing pipeline remains responsive even under heavy log traffic.
    Load Balancing: Implement load balancing to distribute incoming logs evenly across the processing services to avoid bottlenecks.

By integrating a streaming architecture with the above methods, you can significantly reduce the time required to detect anomalies in your logs, thereby improving the responsiveness and effectiveness of your log monitoring and analysis system.
